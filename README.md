# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
*Performing analysis on Kickstarter project data to uncover trends for Louise*

## Overview of Project
Louise has begun fundraising for her play *Fever* on Kickstarter and has asked us to analyze campaign data from similar projects on the site. 
### Purpose
Our goal is to compare fundraising data from similar campaigns across Kickstarter. Through careful analysis, we can make strong recommendations to Louise about how to ensure the successful funding of her play *Fever*.

## Analysis & Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
As *Fever* continues to gain funding, Louise has asked us to look at the success rates of similar plays based on their launch date. We first filtered the data to only show Kickstarter data from plays, then we were able to look at the launch dates by month to determine if any trends emerged. As shown in the line chart below, there seems to be a significant correlation between launch date and the success of these fundraisers, with campaigns launched between April and August having a higher success rate. Furthermore, the number of successful and failed campaigns is nearly equal in December, leading us to assume that fundraising is more difficult around the end of the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Another key variable we decided to investigate was the fundraising goal of similar Kickstarter plays. The data in the chart below seems to suggest an overall negative relationship between the goal of a campaign and the success rate, increasing the chances of failure as the goal increases. However, there is an inversion in this relationship with unusually high success rates between the goals of $35,000 and $45,000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
While we were able to see and analyze some useful trends in the fundraising data, there are still questions that could help Louise better prepare for the success of her campaign. For example, while the number of successful Kickstarters increases during the summer months, so does the number of failed campaigns, although by a smaller margin, which could be a result of some other variable not measured in our dataset. Looking also at the outcomes based on goals, more information is needed to explain the sudden jump is success rates for the high goal fundraisers between $35,000 and $45,000. Additionally, I suggest looking at the releases of popular Broadway plays and whether their commercial success has a positive correlation with the success of crowdfunded plays like *Fever*. 

## Results
Based on the analysis of the Kickstarter dataset, I would recommend that Louise launch her play *Fever* sometime in the summer, preferably around the month of May. Likewise, Louise would benefit from keeping her fundraising goal at or below $10,000. By following these recommendations, I believe Louise's play *Fever* has a better chance of reaching full funding.
