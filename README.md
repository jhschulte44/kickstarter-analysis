# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
*Performing analysis on Kickstarter project data to uncover trends for Louise*

## Overview of Project
Louise has begun fundraising for her play *Fever* on Kickstarter and has asked us to analyze campaign data from similar projects on the site. 
### Purpose
Our goal is to compare fundraising data from similar campaigns across Kickstarter. Through careful analysis, we can make strong recommendations to Louise about how to ensure the successful funding of her play *Fever*.

## Analysis & Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
As *Fever* continues to gain funding, Louise has asked us to look at the success rates of similar plays based on their launch date. We first filtered the data to only show Kickstarter data from plays, then we were able to look at the launch dates by month to determine if any trends emerged. As shown in the line chart below, there seems to be a significant correlation between launch date and the success of these fundraisers, with campaigns launched between April and August having a higher success rate.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Another key variable we decided to investigate was the fundraising goal of similar Kickstarter plays. The data in the chart below seems to suggest an overall negative relationship between the goal of a campaign and the sucess rate, increasing the chances of failure as the goal increases. However, there is an inversion in this relationship with unusually high success rates between the goals of $35,000 and $45,000.
